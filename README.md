 thisproject aimed at developing a robust
methodology for the early detection of CKD using machine
learning techniques. The objective is to leverage the power of
ensemble learning, an approach that combines the predictions
of multiple machine learning models, to enhance the accuracy
and reliability of CKD detection. By analyzing clinical data,
including physiological variables, medical history, and laboratory tests, our project seeks to identify early markers and
patterns associated with CKD development.
